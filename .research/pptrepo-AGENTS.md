## Production Pipeline

`storyboard_planning.py` owns pure Step 2 plan normalization, narration-to-
visual mapping validation, minimal AI user-input serialization, and Visual
Contract composition. `storyboard_service.py` re-exports those functions for
compatibility but must keep request orchestration, persistence, and finalization
separate from the pure planning layer.
`storyboard_profiles.py` owns pipeline-profile sanitization, YAML validation,
editor patches, project profile loading, and built-in storyboard rules. Profile
logic must not return to the request-oriented service module.
`storyboard_prompt_templates.py` owns Step 2 Prompt file paths, built-in and
custom Prompt templates, legacy Prompt migration, compatibility detection, and
composed Prompt responses. Runtime persistence/name/timestamp capabilities are
injected once by `configure_storyboard_dependencies`.
`storyboard_llm.py` owns bounded Step 2 chat-completion execution, JSON-mode
fallback, response cleanup/repair, timeout translation, logging, and client
closure. `storyboard_service.py` owns only the configured wrapper and vendor
selection; keep direct model-client calls out of it.

The application has six user-visible steps:

1. Import an article or generate one from a topic.
2. Plan article-to-slide and slide-to-visualization output.
3. Configure image style/background and generate or upload one 1920×1080 image per slide.
4. Run automatic multimodal AI Mask annotation.
5. Edit narration, generate audio, and confirm audio.
6. Export and manage videos or image-only PPTX presentations.

### User-visible steps vs internal step numbers

The UI is intentionally compressed to six user-visible steps, while the backend and historical validation scripts still use internal Step numbers.

| User-visible step | Internal API / artifact stage | Main artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Step 1 Import article | Step 1 import | `inputs/article.md` |
| Step 2 Plan storyboard | Step 2 storyboard / visual contract | `planning/visual_contract.json` |
| Step 3 Images | Step 3 images + Step 4 confirmation | `slides/<slide_id>/visual_draft.png`, `reveal_manifest.json` |
| Step 4 Mask | Step 5 reveal manifest / mask assets | `reveal_manifest.json`, reveal layer assets |
| Step 5 Narration and audio | Step 6 narration + Step 7 TTS/audio confirmation | `planning/narration_beats.json`, audio, subtitles, timelines |
| Step 6 Output works | Step 8 Remotion render / PPTX export | `remotion_props.json`, rendered video, `.render.json` sidecar, image-only `.pptx` |

When writing user-facing documentation, prefer the six visible steps. When changing API routes, validators, or runtime artifacts, use the internal step numbers and keep this mapping accurate.

## UI Style Source of Truth

The current product UI is the soft blue-purple "Soft Pastel Studio" interface, not the older black-outline sketch style.

- Primary reference: `docs/ui_style_reference.md`.
- Implementation reference: the lower half of `static/style.css`, especially `/* Soft Pastel Studio refinement layer */`.
- Do not treat the early `Flat Outline UI` block in `static/style.css` as the intended design direction. It is a legacy compatibility foundation for existing class names such as `.sketch-border`, `.sketch-dashed`, and `.sketch-shadow`.
- Keep existing `sketch-*` class names only for DOM compatibility unless doing a deliberate CSS migration. New visual work should use the blue-purple palette, soft borders, rounded cards, glass header, and gradient AI action buttons from the Soft Pastel Studio layer.
- If the UI appears as heavy black borders or hard offset shadows, first check whether the browser is loading the full `static/style.css` and whether the Soft Pastel Studio layer is present.

## Frontend Module Boundaries

- `static/workflow_state.js` is the only shared workflow-state entry. It owns
  flow imports, state construction, `projectFlowContext`, and the explicit
  `window.PPTStudio.runtime` bridge. Do not recreate `static/app.js`.
- `static/ui_foundation.js` owns Toast presentation, the shared confirmation
  modal, HTML escaping, narration de-duplication, and textarea sizing. Load it
  before transport and feature modules; keep these primitives out of the shared
  workflow-state entry.
- `static/api_client.js` owns the shared HTTP transport, request marker, response
  decoding, and error propagation. `static/artifact_repair.js` owns the
  project-scoped legacy-artifact repair prompt and retry guard. Keep both out of
  the workflow-state entry, with the API client loaded before every feature module.
- `static/settings.js` owns LLM provider presets/detection, settings form
  synchronization, configuration package import/export, and LLM/image/TTS
  connection checks. Keep these functions and provider constants out of
  `workflow_state.js`; the classic script order intentionally preserves existing inline
  handlers and event registration.
- `static/projects.js` owns project-library rendering, project creation, and
  deletion. Render user-provided names/descriptions through `escHtml` and bind
  card actions with event listeners instead of interpolated inline handlers.
- `static/article.js` owns the visible Step 1 article workflow: source-mode
  switching, topic generation, manual import/editing, and article-generation
  System Content. Keep Step 1 functions out of `workflow_state.js`; a saved article must
  restore the edit action when the project is reopened.
- `static/storyboard.js` owns the visible Step 2 storyboard workflow: result
  loading, AI generation, manual slide editing, batch import/delete, visual and
  narration mapping, autosave, and contract persistence. Keep those functions
  out of `workflow_state.js`.
- `static/storyboard_prompts.js` owns the Step 2 Prompt editor and reusable
  Prompt-template lifecycle: modal loading, full-Prompt preview composition,
  template selection/create/delete, and prompt persistence. Keep this workflow
  out of both `workflow_state.js` and `storyboard.js`.
- `static/images.js` owns the visible Step 3 image workflow: image-state loading,
  grid and preview rendering, single/batch generation, single/batch upload,
  deletion, drag reassignment, candidate application, and Step 3 confirmation.
  Keep these functions and their transient state out of `workflow_state.js`; Step 3 Prompt
  settings and project image-style management remain separate concerns.
- `static/image_prompts.js` owns Step 3 image-generation Prompt loading, full
  preview composition, editing, reset, and persistence. It also exposes the
  explicit `window.refreshStep3Prompts` bridge consumed by image-style changes.
  Keep these functions out of both `workflow_state.js` and `images.js`.
- `static/mask_reveal.js` owns Reveal animation presets, normalization, and
  project-wide propagation into Mask groups and semantic blocks. Keep these
  constants and functions out of `workflow_state.js`; load it before the Mask workspace.
- `static/mask_workspace.js` owns the visible Step 5 Mask workspace shell:
  project-scoped state reset/loading, reveal and narration normalization, Slide
  navigation, workspace/semantic-card/narration rendering, fragment mapping,
  selection, review focus, and the explicit workspace bridges consumed by the
  AI Mask extension. Keep Canvas editing and persistence out of this module.
- `static/mask_editor.js` owns the Step 5 Canvas editing lifecycle: brush and
  eraser input, pointer/touch sampling, zoom, manual Mask rasterization, source/
  Mask/final previews, animation settings and preview, draft autosave/flush,
  semantic-block execution, final confirmation, and its explicit global bridges.
  Keep these functions out of `workflow_state.js` and `mask_workspace.js`.
- `static/subtitle_settings.js` owns subtitle form normalization, project font
  loading, live preview, reset, and persistence. Keep subtitle configuration out
  of `workflow_state.js` and the narration/audio editor.
- `static/narration_audio.js` owns the visible narration-and-audio workspace:
  narration initialization/rendering, AI annotation Prompt and execution,
  TTS-markup normalization, editor autosave/flush, audio-status rendering, TTS
  generation, playback readiness, and audio confirmation. Keep these functions
  out of `workflow_state.js`.
- `static/output_render.js` owns the visible output workspace: persistent PPTX
  and video job polling/recovery, readiness and error presentation, artifact
  lists/download/delete actions, render submission, and playback-speed variants.
  Keep output task state and handlers out of `workflow_state.js`.
- `static/prompt_help.js` owns the shared Prompt input/output help catalog and
  help modal. Keep help content and modal construction out of `workflow_state.js`.
- `static/workspace_navigation.js` owns project workspace entry/exit, AI-mode
  switching, stepper state refresh, visible-step navigation, and step data
  routing. It must load before extension scripts that wrap workspace navigation.
- `static/event_bindings.js` owns DOM startup and all page-level event binding.
  It must load after every core workflow module, while its DOMContentLoaded
  callback remains the only shared frontend boot entry.
- New extractions must preserve current DOM IDs and API paths, add an explicit
  script tag in `static/index.html`, and extend `checks/test_frontend_quality.js`
  with an ownership guard.

The production visual path is:

```text
article.md
-> visual_contract.json
-> visual_prompt.md
-> visual_draft.png
-> automatic element detection and multimodal narration matching
-> exact RLE Masks plus optional manual correction strokes in reveal_manifest.json
-> scripts/build_reveal_scene.py
-> scripts/bind_reveal_timeline.py
-> scripts/build_remotion_props.py
-> Remotion MP4
```

## Automatic AI Mask Contract

`ai_mask_component_detection.py` owns deterministic white-background flood
fill, morphology, connected components, projection splitting, exact row-run RLE,
and the detection cache. `ai_mask_engine.py` may re-export its public helpers for
compatibility, but must not take component-detection implementations back.
`ai_mask_contracts.py` owns cross-stage constants. `ai_mask_manifest_apply.py`
owns exact Mask construction, manual-correction protection, review issue
generation, and mutation of `reveal_manifest.json` groups. Keep those
implementations out of `ai_mask_engine.py` as well.
`ai_mask_assignment.py` owns fallback matching, model-result cleanup, title
region consolidation, narrated-group anchoring, deterministic residual
component completion, and semantic/coverage quality gates. The engine remains
the prompt/config compatibility surface, multimodal request adapter, and
project-level orchestrator.

`scripts/build_reveal_scene.py` is the only production reveal builder.

- Pipeline version: `exact_rle_mask_with_manual_corrections_v5`.
- AI Mask detects separable elements, names candidate crops, and maps narrated
  visual groups to those candidates with a multimodal model.
- Every foreground component is required. Visual-only and decorative components
  are attached to the nearest narrated semantic anchor.
- The automatic result is stored as exact `manual_mask.rle` row runs. Optional
  manual paint/erase strokes are applied on top as corrections.
- A slide without a Mask is a static full-slide image.
- A slide with an exact or manually painted Mask starts from the configured video background.
- Generated images must use a pure-white outer background.
- Each automatic Mask is a processing boundary; only near-white pixels connected
  inward from that boundary are removed.
- White areas enclosed by content are preserved.
- A reveal layer retains non-white source content inside that group's saved
  Mask, with soft antialias alpha and white-edge decontamination.
- The source image must never be reused as the background of a masked slide.
- Automatic masks must reach at least 99.5% foreground coverage with zero
  unassigned components and zero cross-group pixel overlap.
- The reveal builder must not rematch semantic ownership; that belongs to the
  AI Mask stage. Manual brush, eraser, add, and delete remain available as fallback.
- Rebuild slide assets and Remotion runtime assets before every render.
- Validate the pipeline version and reject unreferenced legacy assets before rendering.

## Image Rules

- The PPT body comes from an approved bitmap image.
- Use 1920×1080, 16:9.
- Generate a pure-white (`#FFFFFF`) outer background.
- The final video canvas color is configurable; the default is `#FEFDF9`.
- Keep independent visual groups separated.
- Keep important body content above the subtitle area.
- Remotion may display PNGs, animate reveal PNGs, play audio, and draw
  transparent-background subtitles. It must not redraw PPT body content with
  HTML, SVG, Canvas, or React shapes.

## State and File Lifecycle

- Production schema changes use consecutive `migrations/NNNN_name.sql` files
  through `database_migrations.py`; never restore `create_all` or startup-time
  handwritten `ALTER TABLE` calls. Applied migrations are immutable and
  checksum protected.
- Business-level downstream invalidation belongs in
  `invalidation_service.py`. The service updates files and project state but
  never commits; API callers own one database commit.
- Replacing or deleting a slide image clears that slide's Masks, reveal assets,
  Remotion props, audio confirmation, and downstream completion state.
- Editing narration clears audio confirmation.
- Rendering is blocked until all slide audio has been generated and confirmed.
- Rendered videos carry a `.render.json` sidecar with the reveal pipeline
  version.
- Video render jobs and PPTX export jobs are persisted in the `local_jobs`
  SQLite table. In-memory task maps are compatibility caches, not the source of
  truth. Jobs left active by an exited process are marked `interrupted`.
- A successful video job must clear any earlier error text: its persistent
  terminal state is `succeeded` / `completed` / `100` with `error = NULL`.
- End-to-end entrypoints must not import `server` at module import time. Load
  the composition root only after side-effect-free provider preflight passes,
  so test discovery cannot mutate live job recovery state.
- Newly rendered and speed-adjusted MP4 files are registered in
  `artifact_records`; deleting a video must remove the matching record.
- Deleting a rendered video deletes both the MP4 and its sidecar.
- Runtime data under `runs/`, `outputs/`, `logs/`, and Remotion `public/runtime`
  is never committed.

## Runtime Bridge Policy

The Python startup monkey patch has been retired. AI Mask is now source-owned:

- `ai_mask_config.py` owns persisted settings and Prompt migration.
- `ai_mask_service.py` owns project task orchestration through narrow
  dependencies.
- `ai_mask_routes.py` owns the explicit FastAPI routes.
- `ai_mask_engine.py` owns the deterministic and multimodal matching engine.
- `ai_mask_semantic_matcher.py` owns semantic-object preparation and is
  injected explicitly into the task service; it must never monkey-patch the
  engine.
- AI Mask algorithm code receives only `AiMaskEngineDependencies`; never pass
  a server module, application namespace, or mutable `SimpleNamespace` into
  `ai_mask_engine.py` or `ai_mask_semantic_matcher.py`.
- `project_style_routes.py` owns the Project Profile and Step 3 image-style
  HTTP contract. Its dependencies are configured through
  `project_style_context.py`; storage, reference generation, reverse analysis,
  and templates live in normal `project_*_service.py` / `*_store.py` modules.
- Project-style services receive `ProjectStyleDependencies` directly; do not
  recreate a mutable compatibility namespace or name that dependency
  `server_module`.
- Never restore `register_project_style_routes(server_module)`, route-order
  shadowing, or `runtime_project_*` modules.
- `global_image_style_service.py` owns legacy-compatible global image-style
  settings, reference images, and templates.
  `global_image_style_routes.py` owns the unchanged `/api/image-style/**`
  contract.
- `image_workflow_service.py` owns Step 3 prompt settings, image generation,
  uploads, candidates, ordering, provenance, deletion, and confirmation.
  `image_workflow_routes.py` owns the corresponding HTTP paths.
- `visual_settings_service.py` owns per-project video background and subtitle
  settings, input normalization, file persistence, preview selection, Reveal
  Manifest background synchronization, and downstream invalidation.
  `visual_settings_routes.py` owns their HTTP paths. The service receives only
  storage/lock/contract-reference primitives; never restore business-operation
  callbacks from `server.py`.
- Step 3 service modules must not import `get_db`, declare `Depends`, own an
  `APIRouter`, or import the complete application module.
- `mask_manifest_service.py` owns Step 5 semantic blocks, Manifest repair,
  draft/final persistence, stale-group pruning, and production Reveal builds.
  `mask_preview_service.py` owns exact single-slide preview builds and reports,
  while `mask_editor_routes.py` owns the seven unchanged editor HTTP routes.
  Mask services receive only their frozen dependency records and must not
  import `server`, `get_db`, declare `Depends`, or own an `APIRouter`.
- `diagnostics_routes.py` and `storyboard_background.py` own explicit
  `APIRouter` instances and are included directly by `server.py`.
- `storyboard_service.py` owns Step 2 prompt/profile normalization, planning,
  visual-contract composition, validation, repair, and manual skeleton logic.
  `storyboard_routes.py` owns all Step 2 and storyboard-template HTTP paths.
  Dependencies are configured explicitly with `StoryboardDependencies`; never
  restore Step 2 route decorators in `server.py` or import the server module
  from storyboard code.
- `visual_contract_service.py` owns shared visual-type normalization,
  narration deduplication, visual-contract normalization, and contract slide
  identity reads. It must remain independent of FastAPI, database wiring, and
  the application module; Storyboard, Narration, TTS, Image, and Mask code
  should reuse this source of truth instead of duplicating contract rules.
- `runtime_support.py` owns bounded subprocess execution, safe validator
  stdout parsing, fallback JSON reads, JSON Markdown cleanup, debug-text
  persistence, bounded numeric parsing, range parsing, and nested timeout
  detection. It must remain independent of FastAPI, database wiring, and the
  application module; `server.py` may re-export these helpers for compatibility
  but must not restore their implementations.
- `json_llm_service.py` owns shared configured JSON generation and the bounded
  one-shot JSON repair path. `server.py` may re-export these helpers for route
  dependency wiring, but must not own model request or repair implementations.
- `project_path_service.py` owns validated project run directories, current
  Visual Contract slide identity checks, and slide artifact paths translated
  into stable HTTP errors. `template_utils.py` owns reusable template name
  validation and timestamps. Keep both independent of the application module.
- `server.py` is a composition root only: it configures dependency records,
  includes routers, installs middleware, and mounts static files. Do not add
  top-level business functions or request models to it. Size-boundary checks
  protect this rule and the previously extracted frontend, AI Mask, and
  Storyboard modules from regressing into monoliths.
- `project_runtime_service.py` owns project-scoped logging and secret
  redaction, artifact locks, current-slide image completeness, Reveal Manifest
  synchronization, TTS artifact adapters, and commit-owning workflow
  transitions. Initial article import completes Step 1 and begins Step 2 in one
  commit through `begin_storyboard_after_article_import`. It must remain
  independent of FastAPI, database wiring, and the
  application module; `server.py` may re-export these helpers for compatibility
  but must not restore their implementations.
- `repository_paths.py` is the only source of repository-root, runtime-data,
  style asset, storyboard template, and Prompt template file paths. Consumers
  may re-export or monkey-patch imported module-level names for compatibility,
  but must not recalculate these paths or add application wiring to the path
  registry. Global image-style storage initialization remains owned by
  `global_image_style_service.py`.
- `narration_service.py` and `narration_routes.py` own Step 6 initialization,
  annotation, repair, persistence, and HTTP paths. `tts_service.py` and
  `tts_routes.py` own Step 7 synthesis, retry/status, audio download, and
  confirmation. Both services receive narrow dependency records and must not
  import the application module or restore route decorators in `server.py`.
- `narration_audio_service.py` owns narration source/TTS synchronization,
  Minimax delivery markup, subtitle segmentation, narration file persistence,
  and beat-aligned audio timeline rewriting. It receives only
  `NarrationAudioDependencies`; never move these implementations back into
  `server.py` or add FastAPI/database wiring to the service.
- `project_service.py` and `project_routes.py` own project creation, listing,
  detail, AI mode, and deletion. Creating a project must remain independent
  from importing article content; an empty Step 1 project is valid.
- `one_click_routes.py` owns the One-click HTTP contract.
  `one_click_orchestrator.py` receives only `OneClickDependencies`; it must
  never receive the FastAPI application or the complete `server` module.
- `pipeline_services.py` receives an immutable `PipelineOperations` graph,
  grouped into storyboard, images, Mask, narration, and media capabilities.
  Add a named operation when the pipeline grows; never pass `server`,
  `ModuleType`, or an application namespace into this facade.
- `pptx_routes.py` owns the explicit PPTX HTTP contract.
  `pptx_service.py` owns persistent export jobs and artifact lifecycle, and
  receives only `PptxServiceDependencies` (`session_factory`, `runs_root`, and
  an optional executor). Never restore `register_pptx_routes(server_module)`.
- `video_routes.py` owns the explicit render, polling, MP4 collection,
  download, speed-adjustment, deletion, and legacy final-video routes.
  `video_render_service.py` owns only orchestration, the in-memory task cache,
  and per-project locks. `video_job_store.py` owns persistent SQLite jobs,
  `video_artifact_service.py` owns MP4 paths, freshness metadata, speed
  variants, and registry lifecycle, while `remotion_runner.py` owns bounded
  subprocess stages and color validation. Shared configuration and errors live
  in `video_contracts.py`. Never collapse these boundaries or move Step 8
  workers and route decorators back into `server.py`.
- Never restore `_register(server_module)` in diagnostics, storyboard
  background, or One-click code.
- Access control is installed explicitly from `app_security.py`.
- `route_inventory.py` is the only production inspection API for the effective
  HTTP route surface. FastAPI may retain included routers as nested entries;
  diagnostics and route-contract tests must not infer public routes from a
  direct `app.routes` scan.
- `ai_provider_service.py` owns the shared OpenAI-compatible client,
  bounded image decoding, 1920x1080 white-canvas normalization, image
  response extraction, and provider-specific image-generation fallbacks.
  It must not import the application module or own FastAPI/database wiring.
- `tts_provider_service.py` owns provider aliases/defaults, credential
  resolution, environment-only secret transport, generic TTS command
  construction, and bounded retry/backoff behavior. It receives only
  `TtsProviderDependencies` and must not import `server` or own
  FastAPI/database wiring.
- `settings_service.py` owns global settings persistence, credential masking,
  masked-placeholder preservation, and provider connection checks.
  `config_portability_service.py` owns configuration export/import and
  validates every image reference before any write.
  `settings_routes.py` owns the eight unchanged `/api/settings` and
  `/api/config` HTTP routes, including bounded request streaming.
  These services receive only frozen dependency records and must not import
  `server`, `get_db`, declare `Depends`, or own an `APIRouter`.
- `article_service.py` owns the Step 1 article Prompt setting, topic-only
  generation contract, `inputs/article.md` source lifecycle, legacy brief
  migration, and change-triggered invalidation. `article_routes.py` owns the
  six unchanged settings/import/result HTTP routes. The service receives only
  `ArticleDependencies` and must not import `server`, `get_db`, declare
  `Depends`, or own an `APIRouter`.

Treat the remaining compatibility modules as migration debt, not as the normal
extension mechanism. Never reintroduce `sitecustomize.py`, polling installers,
or global standard-library monkey patches. New fixes should land in
`server.py`, normal service modules, `static/**`, or explicit application
startup code.

Also verify the six visible steps in the local browser, including the exact

## Prompt Optimization Policy

All new or modified production prompts must use
`.agents/skills/optimize-prompts/SKILL.md` before implementation.

- Trace the real system message, user payload, attached images/files, output
  parser, fallback, and downstream consumer. Do not optimize a template in
  isolation.
- Keep model input minimum and necessary: stable rules appear once in the
  system prompt; each request contains only facts needed for the model's next
  decision; deterministically derivable fields stay in code.
- Do not ask a model to return IDs or fields that are absent from its input, or
  values that the application can expand, sort, count, or validate itself.
- Preserve user-editable prompt settings and complete previews. Migrate only
  recognized legacy built-in defaults; never overwrite genuine custom prompts.
- Add tests that prove the runtime payload, output contract, migration, and UI
  preview remain aligned.

## Git Rules

Commit reusable application and framework files:

```text

database.py
config_store.py
static/**
scripts/**
checks/**
config/**
references/**

```

Merged temporary branches with `ahead_by=0` relative to `main` should be deleted after confirming no follow-up work depends on them.
